## About the Site
This project is a web site that create a password for you, based on the configuration that you put in the "Config" button. You have only to click on "Generate" to create a password at the first position of the list. If you want one more password you have to click at "+" button, the it will add one more place at the list to generate. Everytime you press "Generate" the first position of the list is replaced with a new password. The same as the "Delete" button, you will delete the first place of the list, so it will delete the password too and the list will be atualized. If the checkbox near to the "Delete" button is checked, all the passwords from the list will be removed if the you press "Delete". The button "Download" create an archive "passwords.txt" with all the passwords that you generated.
